<h1 id="header1"">Prototype CAN net</h1>
<h3>Fall 2016</h3>
<p>This is a test plataform for labwork to explore the automotive bus 'CAN', developed for my home univeristy UPAEP in Mexico, using real automotive components.</p>
<p>My team and I participated & presented the project in a regional exposition event called 'Expo Ciencias' in Puebla, Mexico.</p>
<p>Bus systems play a HUGE role now a days in automotive communications, due to exponential grow of technology and the motivation to increase safety in today's automobile.</p>
<br>
<p>A bus system is a way/medium to transport data between computer components, microcontrollers or a component that processes information. In our case this components are the so called "Nodes".</p>
<p>Each node shares the physical medium of 2 wires according to the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/63648.html">CAN standard</a>. This enables them to exchange information, both to listen and transmit data onto the bus.</p>
<p>The interaction structure of the nodes is based on a Master-Slave, where 1 node acts as a gateway to control the other nodes which in consecuence interacts with the automotive components, this network is based on a ring topoloy.</p>
<p> Our Bus Node architecture works with a 3 layer simplified model (based on OSI model). Made of an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardUno">Arduino UNO</a> board as a microcontroller, a communication controller & transceiver. This last 2 come embedded in a <a href="http://wiki.seeed.cc/CAN-BUS_Shield_V1.2/">CAN Bus shield</a>. For the shield to work propoerly it was requeried by the standard that every node must have a termination resistance matching the impedance of the lines to avoid reflections, usually 120 ohms.</p>
<p>The <a href="">software</a> part was developed with the help of an open source <a href="https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield">library</a>, to enable simple call of functions to work with the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21801d.pdf">MCP2515</a> controller embedded in the shield. We developed our own messages by declaring our own IDs and adding data in the CAN frame message.</p>
<p>Finally the prototype has 2 "new" applications, it implements safety and security functions. This were ideas we as a team came up with, to show how easy it is to add information to the network, both implemented in code and in relative cheap hardware.</p>
<br>
<p>We know that seeing just cables can be boring or not eye cathching, that's why on our first presentation in Fall 2016 we developed a CAD vehicle and send it to manufacture to a bike store. Then for the next exposition in Winter 2016 we partner up with <a href="http://www.zios.com.mx/">'Zios'</a>, an industrial design company, to develop a physcial chasis. The result was a scale size convertible "vehicle" based on Tesla Roadster.</p>
<p>This project was created with Manuel Rodriguez and Fernanda Rivera.</p>
